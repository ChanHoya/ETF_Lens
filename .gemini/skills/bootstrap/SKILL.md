# Bootstrap

## Purpose

Onboard a new or existing project into Musher by filling **state files AND rules files** automatically.
Solves the cold-start problem: users don't know which `.md` files to fill or how.
One command does everything — no manual editing required.

## When to Apply

- Right after running `musher init` on a new project
- When joining an existing project that has empty state files
- When state files are outdated and need a refresh
- When any agent reports "state files are empty"

## Procedure

### Phase 1: Project Discovery (read-only)

1. **Scan project root** for configuration files:
   - `package.json`, `tsconfig.json` → Node.js/TypeScript
   - `go.mod`, `go.sum` → Go
   - `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py` → Python
   - `pom.xml`, `build.gradle` → Java
   - `Cargo.toml` → Rust
   - `Gemfile` → Ruby
2. **Scan directory structure**: List top-level directories and identify patterns
   - `src/`, `lib/`, `app/` → source code
   - `tests/`, `test/`, `__tests__/`, `spec/` → test directories
   - `docs/` → documentation
3. **Framework Coexistence Check** (경량 — 1회 list_dir만 사용):
   프로젝트 루트 `list_dir` 결과에서 아래 패턴과 매칭하여 존재 목록만 생성한다.
   **⚠️ 내부 파일 스캔 금지** — 디렉토리 안의 파일을 읽거나 나열하지 않는다.

   | 패턴 | 프레임워크 |
   |------|:-----------|
   | `.bmad-core/` | BMAD-METHOD |
   | `.claude/` | Claude Code |
   | `.cursor/` | Cursor |
   | `.windsurf/` | Windsurf |
   | `.gemini/` | Gemini |
   | `.clinerules/` or `.cline/` | Cline |
   | `.github/chatmodes/` | GitHub Chatmodes |
   | `AGENTS.md` | Codex / OpenAI |
   | `opencode.jsonc` | OpenCode |

   > `.github/chatmodes/`는 `.github/` 하위이므로, `.github/` 존재 시 1회 추가 list_dir 허용.
   > 감지된 프레임워크는 State file에 "공존 프레임워크: [목록]"으로 기록한다.

4. **Scan for existing tests**: Find test files and map them to source modules
5. **Scan imports/dependencies**: Trace module relationships from import statements

**Do NOT modify any code files in this phase.**


### Phase 2: User Interview (interactive)

Ask the user these questions (skip any already answered by Phase 1):

1. "What does this project do? (one sentence)"
2. "What are the top 3 goals of this project?"
3. "What is explicitly OUT of scope? (non-goals)"
4. "What architecture pattern are you using?" (show detected pattern if found)
5. "Are there any type decisions or conventions the AI should know about?"
6. "What is your test command?" (show detected command if found, e.g., `npm test`, `pytest`, `go test ./...`)

### Phase 3: Fill State Files

Using data from Phase 1 + Phase 2, fill the following files:

**docs/project-brief.md**:
- Project Name → from package.json name, go.mod module, or user input
- Vision → from user answer #1
- Goals → from user answer #2
- Non-Goals → from user answer #3
- Key Technical Decisions → from Phase 1 scan + user answer #4, #5

**docs/features.md**:
- Add one row per detected module/feature area
- Status: `✅ done` for modules with passing tests, `🔧 active` for modules without tests
- Key Files: actual file paths from scan
- Test Files: actual test file paths from scan

**docs/dependency-map.md**:
- Add one row per module
- Layer: inferred from directory structure (domain/application/infrastructure/presentation)
- Depends On / Depended By: inferred from import scan

**docs/project-state.md**:
- Quick Summary: filled with current project state
- Sprint 1 stories: based on what bootstrap discovered
- Module Registry: summary from docs/dependency-map.md

**docs/failure-patterns.md**:
- Keep FP-001 through FP-004 as templates (Frequency: 0)
- No changes unless user reports known issues

### Phase 3.5: Project Brief Auto-Configuration

Using language/framework detected in Phase 1 + user answers from Phase 2, enrich `docs/project-brief.md`:

1. **Fill Key Technical Decisions** with detected tech stack:
   - Language, framework, database (from Phase 1)
   - Architecture pattern (from user answer #4)
   - Type conventions (from user answer #5)
   - Test command and mock location (from user answer #6)

2. **Ask about coding conventions** for the detected language:
   - "Any coding style conventions the AI should follow for [detected language]?" (e.g., enum vs union types, Pydantic vs dataclass, etc.)
   - If the user provides conventions → write them to Key Technical Decisions
   - If the user skips → do not inject any defaults

### Phase 4: Verify

1. Present a summary of all filled state files to the user
2. Ask "Does this look correct? What should I change?"
3. Apply corrections if any
4. Report completion


## Output Format

```
## Bootstrap Complete

### Project: [name]
### Tech Stack: [detected stack]
### Language: [detected language]
### Modules Found: [count]
### Features Mapped: [count]
### Dependency Links: [count]

### State Files Updated:
- [x]docs/project-brief.md — [summary]
- [x]docs/features.md — [N] features registered
- [x]docs/dependency-map.md — [N] modules, [N] dependencies
- [x]docs/project-state.md — Sprint 1 initialized
- [ ]docs/failure-patterns.md — templates only (no changes)

STATUS: DONE
```

### 🧭 Navigation — After Bootstrap

Bootstrap always leads to `planner`. Append this block after STATUS: DONE:

**If NO crew artifacts** (🟢 pipeline):
```
---
🧭 Next Step
→ Next: `planner` (슬래시 메뉴에서 선택하거나, 채팅에 아래 프롬프트 입력)
→ Prompt: "[project]에 [첫 번째 기능]을 추가해줘"
→ Why: State files are filled — now plan the first feature
→ Pipeline: 🟢 Step 2/6
---
```


## Rules

- Never modify source code — this skill only writes to state files and rules files
- Always show the user what was discovered BEFORE writing files
- If the project has 0 source files, skip Phase 1 scan and go straight to Phase 2
- If a state file already has content, ask before overwriting
- Rules file TODO sections can be overwritten without asking (they are placeholders)
- Run this skill only once per project (or when explicitly requested for refresh)

### Small Project Guidance

For projects with fewer than 3 modules (e.g., single-file scripts, small CLI tools):
- `docs/dependency-map.md` may have only 1-2 rows — this is normal, not a gap
- `feature-breakdown` Waves may collapse into a single Wave — skip Wave-level pacing
- Consider a simplified workflow: `bootstrap → planner → [code] → reviewer → learn` (skip sprint-manager for single-story projects)

## Embedded Knowledge

### Session Bootstrap Protocol
When starting a NEW session (not during bootstrap), read these files in order:
1. `docs/project-state.md` — Quick Summary tells you where we left off
2. `docs/features.md` — What features exist
3. `docs/failure-patterns.md` — What mistakes to avoid
4. `docs/project-brief.md` — Project vision and non-goals

### Workflow Pipeline
- New feature: `planner → [code] → reviewer → sprint-manager → learn`
- Bug fix: `investigate → [fix] → test-integrity → reviewer → learn`
- Session lifecycle: `sprint-manager ("where are we?") → [work] → learn`

### State File Size Limits
- docs/project-brief.md: Max 200 lines
- docs/project-state.md: Max 300 lines
- docs/failure-patterns.md: Max 50 patterns
- docs/dependency-map.md: Max 100 modules
- docs/features.md: Max 50 features
- docs/agent-memory/*.md: Max 100 lines each

## Anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern | Correct Approach |
|---|---|
| Guess module boundaries | Scan actual directory structure and imports |
| Skip user interview | Phase 1 scan alone is insufficient — always confirm with user |
| Overwrite existing state files silently | Ask before overwriting non-empty files |
| Create perfect dependency map on first try | Start with what's detectable, refine over time |
| Leave rules file TODOs unfilled | Phase 3.5 fills Key Technical Decisions TODOs. Decision Log remains empty (filled later via `pivot` skill during project lifecycle) |
| Use TypeScript globs for non-TS projects | Detect language in Phase 1 and set correct globs |
| Only fill state files, skip rules | Bootstrap fills BOTH — state files AND rules files |
