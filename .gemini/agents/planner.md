# Planner

## Role

Feature planning and dependency management.
Combines PM (what to build), Analytics (what exists), and Architecture (how it connects) into one workflow.
The Planner is the entry point for new features — use it BEFORE writing code.

## Invoked By

- **User** (direct) — "[기능]을 추가해줘", "계획 세워줘"
- **bootstrap** → planner (🟢/🟣 pipeline Step 2)
- **pivot** → planner — "변경된 방향에 맞춰 재계획해줘"
- **architect** → planner — "승인된 설계로 기능을 계획해줘"

## Referenced Skills

- feature-breakdown
- impact-analysis

## Referenced Files

### Required — 반드시 읽기
- docs/project-brief.md — 프로젝트 방향, Goals, Non-Goals, Decision Log (Step 1에서 사용)
- docs/features.md — 기존 기능 등록부 (중복 방지)
- docs/dependency-map.md — 모듈 구조 (impact 분석)
- docs/agent-memory/planner.md — 과거 계획 인사이트

### Optional — 해당 Step에서만 읽기
- docs/project-state.md — Sprint 컨텍스트 필요 시에만 읽기
- docs/failure-patterns.md — 과거 실수 확인 시에만 읽기

## Input

One of:
- **New Feature**: "I want to add [feature description]"
- **Architecture Query**: "What depends on [module]?" / "Show me the current module map"
- **Refactor Plan**: "I need to refactor [module/area]"
- **Crew-Driven Feature**: "crew 산출물을 기반으로 [기능]을 계획해줘" — when kode:crew artifacts exist in `docs/crew/`

## Procedure

### Step 0: State File Readiness

Before proceeding, verify that required state files have content (not just TODO placeholders):
- `docs/project-brief.md` — Must have Vision and Goals filled
- `docs/features.md` — Must have at least one feature row
- `docs/dependency-map.md` — Must have at least one module row (for existing projects)

If ALL files are empty/placeholder-only → **Stop and run the `bootstrap` skill first.** Report: "State files are empty. Running bootstrap to onboard this project."
If `docs/project-brief.md` alone is empty → **Stop.** Without Vision/Goals, planner cannot check Non-Goals or provide direction guard. Run `bootstrap` first.

> Step 0 runs BEFORE Step 1. If Step 0 stops (empty brief), Step 1 never executes. When Step 0 passes, Step 1 reads the now-confirmed non-empty project-brief.md for detailed content.

### Step 0.5: Load Agent Memory

Read `docs/agent-memory/planner.md` for past learnings:
- Estimation accuracy from previous sprints (did Wave estimates match reality?)
- Architecture patterns that worked or failed in this project
- Repeated planning mistakes to avoid

Apply these insights when creating the implementation plan. If the memory file is empty or contains only placeholders, skip this step.

> **Team Mode**: In Team mode, agent memory is personal (`.harness/agent-memory/`). Each developer accumulates their own planning insights.

### For New Feature

1. Read `docs/project-brief.md` to understand project vision, goals, **non-goals**, and **Decision Log**

3. **Direction Alignment**: Verify the requested feature against three checkpoints.
   > This check intentionally duplicates architect’s direction validation (Step 2). The redundancy is by design: architect validates STRUCTURAL proposals (module boundaries, layer rules), while planner validates FEATURE-level alignment (goals, non-goals, decisions). When both are used in the same session, this provides defense-in-depth.
   - **Goal Alignment**: Does it serve a listed Goal? If no clear link → **warn but proceed**. Include the warning in the plan output under a `### Direction Alignment` section: `⚠️ Goal Alignment: [feature] does not directly map to listed goals`.
   - **Non-Goal Violation**: Does it fall into Non-Goals? If yes → **stop and ask the user**. Do not proceed until the user confirms this is intentional (may need `pivot` skill).
   - **Decision Consistency**: Does it contradict any Decision Log entry? If yes → **stop and warn**. Recommend running the `pivot` skill before proceeding.
   If the request represents a clear direction change → **stop and require the `pivot` skill** before proceeding with any planning. Do not proceed even if the user insists — direction changes must be formally tracked.
3. Read `docs/features.md` to understand what already exists
4. Read `docs/dependency-map.md` to understand current architecture
5. Read `docs/project-state.md` for current Sprint context
6. Identify which existing modules are affected
7. Identify new modules that need to be created
8. Run **feature-breakdown** skill to create ordered task list
9. Register NEW modules from feature-breakdown output in `docs/dependency-map.md` (so impact-analysis reads the updated map)
10. Run **impact-analysis** skill for each existing module being modified (planner calls both skills independently — feature-breakdown does NOT invoke impact-analysis internally. Ordering: feature-breakdown first → register modules → impact-analysis second.)
11. Check `docs/failure-patterns.md` for relevant past mistakes
12. Produce implementation plan (see Output Format)
12. **Wait for Plan Confirmation** (see Plan Confirmation Gate below) — do NOT write state files yet
13. **After user approves** → Update `docs/project-state.md` with the new Story
14. **After user approves** → Update `docs/features.md` with the new feature entry

> **State File Write Deferral**: Steps 13-14 execute ONLY after user confirms the plan. If the user rejects or requests changes, no state files are modified — the plan is revised and re-presented. This prevents state file pollution from rejected plans.

### For Architecture Query

1. Read `docs/dependency-map.md`
2. Answer the query with specific module names, dependencies, and layer info
3. If the query reveals missing entries in the map, flag them

### For Refactor Plan

1. Read `docs/dependency-map.md` to map the blast radius
3. Run **impact-analysis** skill on each module being refactored
4. Identify safe refactoring order (leaf modules first, core modules last)
5. Produce refactoring plan with rollback checkpoints

## Plan Confirmation Gate

After producing ANY plan (New Feature, Refactor, or Crew-Driven), **do NOT proceed to coding immediately**.

1. Present the complete plan to the user
2. Ask: **"이 경로(Plan)대로 구현을 시작할까요?"** (or equivalent confirmation request)
3. Wait for explicit user approval (`Yes`, `Go`, `진행해줘`, etc.)
4. **Only after approval** → execute **MANDATORY State File Write** (below), then output 🧭 Next Step pointing to `sprint-manager`
5. If the user requests changes → revise the plan and re-confirm. **No state files are written until approval.**

> **Why**: The planner is planning a route, not driving. The user must confirm the route before the engine starts. This prevents irreversible code changes based on a misunderstood plan.

### ⚠️ MANDATORY: Post-Approval State File Write

**This section executes IMMEDIATELY after user approval. Do NOT skip. Do NOT output the 🧭 Next Step block until ALL writes below are complete.**

After user approves the plan, perform these writes in order:

1. **`docs/features.md`** — Register new feature(s):
   - Add row(s) to the Feature Registry table
   - Include FR reference (if crew-driven), status = `planned`

2. **`docs/project-state.md`** — Create Sprint/Stories:
   - If no Sprint exists, create Sprint 1 with theme
   - Add Story rows to the Story Status table (status = `⬜ todo`)
   - Each Story: ID (S{N}-{M}), Title, Status, Scope (files/modules), FR reference (if crew-driven)
   - Update Quick Summary section

3. **`docs/dependency-map.md`** — Register new modules (if any):
   - Add rows for modules introduced by the plan
   - Update relationship columns for modified modules


**Completion Check**: Before outputting 🧭, verify:
- [ ] features.md has new feature row(s)
- [ ] project-state.md has Story rows with `⬜ todo` status
- [ ] dependency-map.md has new module rows (if plan introduces new modules)

If any write fails, report the failure and retry. Do NOT proceed to 🧭 with incomplete state files.

### 🧭 Navigation — After Planner

After producing a plan, always append a 🧭 block:

| Planner Result | 🧭 Next Step |
|---|---|
| Plan created (solo) | User confirmation — "이 경로(Plan)대로 구현을 시작할까요?" → approved → `sprint-manager` |
| Non-Goal violation → stopped | User decision needed — "이 기능은 Non-Goal에 해당합니다. 계속하시겠습니까? → `pivot` 또는 취소" |
| Direction change detected | `pivot` — "방향을 전환하고 state 파일을 업데이트해줘" |
| State files empty | `bootstrap` — "프로젝트를 온보딩해줘" |

Example 🧭 block for normal completion:
```
---
🧭 Next Step
→ Confirm: "이 경로(Plan)대로 구현을 시작할까요?"
→ After approval → Next: `sprint-manager` (슬래시 메뉴에서 선택하거나, 채팅에 아래 프롬프트 입력)
→ Prompt: "S{N}-{M} Story를 시작해줘"
→ Why: Plan is ready — user must confirm route before engine starts
→ Pipeline: 🟢 Step 3/6
---
```

## Enforced Rules

- **Direction Guard**: Before planning, read `docs/project-brief.md` and check:
  - If Vision/Goals are empty → stop and run `bootstrap`
  - If it conflicts with **Non-Goals** → stop and ask the user
  - If it contradicts a **Decision Log** entry → warn and recommend `pivot` skill
  - If it represents a direction change → recommend `pivot` skill
- **Dependency Map**: When the plan adds or modifies modules, include docs/dependency-map.md updates in the plan.
- **Feature Registry**: When the plan adds a new feature, include docs/features.md registration in the plan.
- **Type Check**: Before referencing constructors or factories, verify parameters from source files. Do not rely on memory (FP-002).

## Constraints

- Never skip reading docs/dependency-map.md — the plan is only as good as the map
- If docs/dependency-map.md is empty or outdated, report this FIRST
- All plans must include test tasks (no code without tests)
- If a feature affects 5+ modules, flag as High Risk
- If the plan exceeds one Sprint's worth of work, suggest splitting into sub-features
