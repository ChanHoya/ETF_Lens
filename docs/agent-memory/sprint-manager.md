# Sprint Manager Memory

> **Initialization**: After the first sprint completes, replace placeholder comments below with real data.
> **Update trigger**: Updated when `learn` skill runs after sprint management actions.

## Velocity Tracking

<!-- Track planned vs completed stories per sprint.
   Format: [Sprint N] Done/Planned (Rate%) — Notes
   Examples:
   - [Sprint 1] 3/5 (60%) — ramp-up phase, scope adjusted mid-sprint
   - [Sprint 2] 4/4 (100%) — right-sized after Sprint 1 calibration
   - [Sprint 3] 5/5 (100%) — team rhythm established
   Benchmark: Set after 3+ sprints. If rate < 50% for 2 consecutive sprints → flag in sprint-manager recommendations.
   Average velocity: recalculate after each sprint (e.g., "Average: 4.0 stories/sprint after 3 sprints")
-->

## Scope Drift History

<!-- Record scope violations caught by sprint-manager or reviewer.
   Format: [Story ID] Drift type — Files affected — Resolution
   Examples:
   - [S1-003] Out-of-scope modification — 3 files in auth/ (not in story scope) — reverted, created new story S1-005
   - [S2-001] Direction change requested — switched to pivot skill — recorded in Decision Log
   - [S2-004] Feature creep — added caching (not planned) — extracted to S3-001
   Pattern: If drift > 2 per sprint → reduce story scope or improve planning precision
-->

## Recommended Patterns

<!-- Record data-backed recommendations for project workflow.
   Format: Recommendation — Evidence (N sprints) — Confidence
   Examples:
   - Plan 4 stories per sprint — based on 5 sprints: avg 4.2 done, 3 caused underutilization, 5+ caused overrun — HIGH
   - Stories touching 5+ files should be split — based on S1-003, S2-004 both overran with 6+ files — MEDIUM
   - Schedule integration stories in Sprint N+1 after domain stories — based on Wave ordering pattern — HIGH
-->

## Story Sizing Accuracy

<!-- Track if story estimates match actual effort to improve future planning.
   Format: [Story ID] Estimated: X, Actual: Y, Ratio — Notes
   Examples:
   - [S1-001] Estimated: 1 session, Actual: 1 session, 1.0x — simple scaffolding
   - [S1-002] Estimated: 2 sessions, Actual: 4 sessions, 2.0x — underestimated DB migration complexity
   - [S2-001] Estimated: 2 sessions, Actual: 2 sessions, 1.0x — applied 1.5x buffer from S1 lesson
   Rule: If ratio > 2.0x for 3+ stories → adjust estimation method (break into smaller tasks or add buffers)
